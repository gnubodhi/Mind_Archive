INTRODUCTION

- **Annotation**: From a contemporary perspective, Freud’s dream research and broader psychoanalytic method cannot be considered scientific in the strict sense, as it relied heavily on subjective interpretation of individual case studies rather than reproducible, controlled experimentation. While he gathered large amounts of qualitative material, his interpretations were often guided by his existing theoretical framework, making them vulnerable to confirmation bias — he tended to find evidence for concepts like wish fulfilment and sexual symbolism because those were the hypotheses he was looking to support. Furthermore, key elements of his theory, such as interpreting patient disagreement as repression, are unfalsifiable and therefore outside the scope of empirical testing. Freud’s strict adherence to his theoretical framework and reluctance to accommodate divergent views also caused personal and professional rifts, most famously with former collaborators Carl Jung and Alfred Adler, who broke away to develop their own schools of thought. Many of Freud’s insights, including the role of unconscious processes and symbolic meaning, remain influential in psychiatry, psychotherapy, and cultural analysis, but they are now treated as historically important starting points rather than universally accepted scientific laws.

DREAMS HAVE A MEANING

- **Annotation**: Freud contrasts the “prescientific” view of dreams — in which they were seen as messages from supernatural forces, either benevolent or hostile — with the modern psychological position that dreams are products of the dreamer’s own mind. This marks a decisive shift from external, mythological explanations to internal, psychical ones. In contemporary terms, Freud treats dreams as intra-psychic phenomena, emerging from the mind’s own processes rather than being imposed from outside. He notes that dreams leave us with distinct impressions or feelings upon waking, even when their imagery is fragmented or illogical. Freud raises the possibility that these impressions and the dream process itself could have a biological function, situating dreams within the broader operations of mental life. He then observes that the popular view continues to hold that dreams carry meaning — that a sense can be made of them much as one would interpret any other mental product — even if the method for uncovering that meaning has remained elusive. He proposes that diseased psychical life often arises from morbid ideas — thought patterns or mental contents that are isolated from the rest of the personality’s conscious network. Among these, he singles out obsessions, describing them as peculiar sensations of dread that feel alien to normal consciousness. In Freud’s view, the therapeutic task is to reconnect these morbid ideas with the rest of the psyche’s content, restoring them to a meaningful place within the individual’s associative network. This reconnection, achieved through analytic exploration, allows the once-isolated material to be integrated, reducing its power to provoke anxiety or disrupt mental life. The underlying premise is that psychic health depends on the free communication of ideas across the mind’s networks — and that pathology often reflects a breakdown in that communication. From here, Freud introduces his own approach to uncovering dream meaning: the method of psycho-analysis, in which the dream is examined through free association and exploration of unconscious material. His writing in this introduction is unusually lyrical for a scientific work; even in translation, it retains a rhythm and precision that bridges poetry and argument — a rare talent that allows him to address the reader both intellectually and emotionally.
Freud’s discussion of morbid ideas and obsessions sets the stage for one of his central psychodynamic claims: that when instinctual drives, particularly sexual desires, are dissociated from conscious awareness, they do not vanish but instead return in distorted or symbolic form. This defensive separation from one’s own impulses — often through repression — leads to a kind of psychic isolation of the drive. Cut off from the moderating influence of conscious thought, the drive may express itself indirectly, for example through obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviours, or seemingly unrelated symptoms. In Freud’s therapeutic model, reconnecting the repressed desire with the rest of the psyche allows for more direct acknowledgment and integration, reducing the need for symptom formation. Here, the groundwork is being laid for his later, more explicit link between repression, sexual instinct, and the genesis of neurosis.
