INTRODUCTION

- **Annotation**: From a contemporary perspective, Freud’s dream research and broader psychoanalytic method cannot be considered scientific in the strict sense, as it relied heavily on subjective interpretation of individual case studies rather than reproducible, controlled experimentation. While he gathered large amounts of qualitative material, his interpretations were often guided by his existing theoretical framework, making them vulnerable to confirmation bias — he tended to find evidence for concepts like wish fulfilment and sexual symbolism because those were the hypotheses he was looking to support. Furthermore, key elements of his theory, such as interpreting patient disagreement as repression, are unfalsifiable and therefore outside the scope of empirical testing. Many of Freud’s insights, including the role of unconscious processes and symbolic meaning, remain influential in psychiatry, psychotherapy, and cultural analysis, but they are now treated as historically important starting points rather than universally accepted scientific laws.
