INTRODUCTION

- **Annotation**: From a contemporary perspective, Freud’s dream research and broader psychoanalytic method cannot be considered scientific in the strict sense, as it relied heavily on subjective interpretation of individual case studies rather than reproducible, controlled experimentation. While he gathered large amounts of qualitative material, his interpretations were often guided by his existing theoretical framework, making them vulnerable to confirmation bias — he tended to find evidence for concepts like wish fulfilment and sexual symbolism because those were the hypotheses he was looking to support. Furthermore, key elements of his theory, such as interpreting patient disagreement as repression, are unfalsifiable and therefore outside the scope of empirical testing. Freud’s strict adherence to his theoretical framework and reluctance to accommodate divergent views also caused personal and professional rifts, most famously with former collaborators Carl Jung and Alfred Adler, who broke away to develop their own schools of thought. Many of Freud’s insights, including the role of unconscious processes and symbolic meaning, remain influential in psychiatry, psychotherapy, and cultural analysis, but they are now treated as historically important starting points rather than universally accepted scientific laws.

DREAMS HAVE A MEANING

- **Annotation**:Freud contrasts the “prescientific” view of dreams — in which they were seen as messages from supernatural forces, either benevolent or hostile — with the modern psychological position that dreams are products of the dreamer’s own mind. This marks a decisive shift from external, mythological explanations to internal, psychical ones. In contemporary terms, Freud treats dreams as intra-psychic phenomena, emerging from the mind’s own processes rather than being imposed from outside. He notes that dreams leave us with distinct impressions or feelings upon waking, even when their imagery is fragmented or illogical. Freud then raises the possibility that these impressions and the dream process itself could have a biological function, situating dreams within the broader operations of mental life. This reframing turns the dream into an object of psychological and potentially biological study, rather than a mystical occurrence, and opens the door to analysing its structure, meaning, and relationship to waking thought.
